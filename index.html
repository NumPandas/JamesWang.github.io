        <p> Hi there! I'm James Wang, a current 3rd-year undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Physics and Mathematics. I've had the opportunity to participate in research in Particle Accelerator and Experimental Condensed Matter Physics. Some of my technical experiences include beam and waveguide simulations, data analysis using python, classical machine learning, and device fabrication. Please see the Experiences section for more information!</p>
        <p> Currently, I'm looking to explore more into quantum informaiton and quantum computing. I have experience with using IBM's Qiskit Library but am looking to improve whenever I can. One way I do this is by implementing quantum computing algorithm on my own and testing/modifying them. You can find descriptions of them in the Projects Section! </p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my website more to learn more about me and if there's any information that isn't readily available, please reach out to me in Email!</p>
        <p>I also enjoy cooking so if you want, take a look at some of my cooking projects in their section!</p>
